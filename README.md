### Features 
The inital plan for this project was to keep some of the basic twitter functions such as liking and retweeting things, while also implementing things we thought that could help improve twitter for our targeted audience. We decided to add some other new features such as a "schedule tweeter" that allows for specific messages to be sent at specific times and a "like and retweet" that allows a tweet that is liked to be retweeted. With many others listed below 
* Delete Tweets - Deletes all the tweets on timeline
* Like - Searches for specific tag to like 
* Unlike - unlikes post that are liked 
* Retweet - retweets posts given a key word 
* Unretweet - unretweet everything 
* timeline - the timeline is visible on webapp
